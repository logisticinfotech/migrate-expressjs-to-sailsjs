Sails.js concept is so much similar to Ruby on Rails or I can say so much similar to Laravel (Trending php framework) also. So for the developer using Express.js there must be some easy way to use Sails.js. Keeping that in my mind I am inspired to write “Migrate your Express.js project to sails.js”.
